Issues to implement:
- 2: short circuit semantics for booleans
- 6: typechecker must check that receive is "external payable"
- 8: typechecker support for state variables declared as constant
- 12: typechecker support for funciton returning multiple values

Status:
- 2: passes the 4 tests in test/shortcut.ml (more testing needed)
- 6: passes the 4 tests in test/externpay.ml (more testing needed)

Other things:
- add more tests
